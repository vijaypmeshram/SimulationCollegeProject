                ABSTRACT

The terms "modelling" and "simulation" are often used interchangeably. The
use of modeling and simulation (M&S) within engineering is well recognized.
Simulation technology belongs to the tool set of engineers of all application domains
and has been included in the body of knowledge of engineering management. M&S has
already helped to reduce costs, increase the quality of products and systems, and
document and archive lessons learned

 Chemical process modeling is a computer modeling technique used in
Chemical Engineering process design. It typically involves using purpose-built software
to define a system of interconnected components, which are then solved so that the
steady-state or dynamic behavior of the system can be predicted.

 The time optimal control problem for water tank system, Unsteady-state steam
heating of a liquid and jacket cooled continuous flow of stirred tank reactor (CSTR) with
an exothermic, irreversible; second-order, homogeneous, liquid-phase reaction will be
solved with the maximum principle and phase plane analysis. Computer simulation
studies will be conducted. In that we will conduct the modeling and simulation of
Lumped parameter systems.
